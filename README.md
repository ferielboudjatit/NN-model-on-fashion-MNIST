# NN-model-on-fashion-MNIST
The purpose behind this pedagogical exercise is to : 

• Load a dataset using tf.keras.datasets

• Build a NN with a hidden layer and Softmax activation layer.

• Practice regularization and optimization methods.

• Understand the impact of most of the hyper-parameters.

• Create and solve and overfitting situation.

• Try to tune all of the parameters in order to get the best accuracy.
